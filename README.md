## General Information

- What is the background of your project?
A consumer finance company that specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers is looking forward to identify and avoid risks of business loss and financial loss. 

The customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters' of loan, who cause largest amount of financial loss to the company

Alternatively business loss comes from not offering loans to consumers who are not going to default the loan. 

- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?
In this project we have performed EDA to analyse the influence of consumer attributes and loan attributes on tendency of loan default.


- What is the dataset that is being used?
loans.csv dataset contains data of all loans applied during the time period 2007 to 2011
